            <img src="map.jpeg" alt="map of UNC campus" width="400" height="400">
            <p> Or be a true "Gen Z" child and use an app to get around. But if you trip on the bricks from staring at your phone thats on you</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The second tip is READ THE SYLLABUS</p> 
            <img src="syllabus.jpeg" alt="syllabus">
            <p> It feels like reading the terms and conditions of a IOS update I know,but it is necessary. All the due dates and little things that might sneak up on you are in here. Plus professors hate it if they have to repeat info you can find yourself.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The third tip is GO to office hours!</p>
            <img src="oh.jpeg" alt="office hours sign" width="400" height="370">

            <p>It might be scary having to speak others in class. However, its worth it. Finding a group to study with helps you by having others that hold you accountable for learning information. It also makes it easier to study for exams. you get to listen to multiple perspectives and also see what works for them in that class.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The last tip is ORGANIZE. ORGANIZE. ORGANIZE.</p>
