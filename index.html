        <h2>Tired of college already?</h2>
        <p> College alone is a hard task for any soul. It's not a netflix show and its absolutely nothing like grown-ish. College is it's own unique monster. However, I have slightly conquered this monster so I created this resource to help you along your way as a UNC stdudent (Sorry to everyone else)
