            <p><strong> RELAX!!!!</strong> Having a social life in college is nothing to stress over. Forming friends can become second nature as long as you put yourself out there, join groups that you are PASSIONATE about. Parties are there every single weekend if you really want to so there is no FOMO. </p> </div>
